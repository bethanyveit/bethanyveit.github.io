    <h4 style="margin-top: 40px">Book Cover Redesign</h4>
    <p style="color: #515459; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">This book cover redesign was an assignment I had for one of my early SMAD classes. This is the project where I really learned how to use Adobe Illustrator. I had some previous experience with it prior to this class, but it was very minimal. Although it may not be my best work, I am still very proud of how the finished product turned out.</p>
    <p style="color: #515459; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">For this project, I was given the assignment to redesign the cover of a book I had read. With Columbine as my basis, I decided to go for a very minimal front cover that incorporated the title into the desing. On the back, I still wanted it to be minimal in the design. I used the two boys cars as my basis and added the other necessary details and text as needed.</p>

    <p style="color: #515459; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">This was my very first website that I created. For the assignment, we used a bootstrap that gave us the navigation and the layout of the site. It is just one page, but this was my stepping stone into html/css. I was required to change the colors, add reading content, and images.</p>
    <p style="color: #515459; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">It is definitely not the most aethetically pleasing site by any means, but it sparked my interest in website coding and design and looking back at this project reminds me how much I've grown as a developer and designer.</p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 40px"><a href="https://www.openprocessing.org/user/237181#sketches" style="color: rgb(134, 136, 138)" target="_blank">Open Processing</a></h4>
    <p style="color: #515459; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">For one of my SMAD classes that I took fall semester of my senior year, we used a website called openprocessing. It was my first real taste into JavaScript. Each sketch that I made had a different purpose and taught me different things. The most difficult one was definitely the data visualization as I had issues making it work, but with some assistance from my professor, I was able to see where I went wrong. I have six different sketches that you are able to view through the link attached to the title.</p>

    <p style="color: #515459; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">For the same SMAD class that I learned Javascript, our first project was to redesign the flow of an app. I decided to go with VSCO, which is a semi-popular picture editing app that also has a social media type feel to it. I thought that by changing small aspects of this app, users would feel more compelled to use it. I enjoyed this assignment a lot as it included not only the redesign of the app, but also some user/target audience research, which is another part of media art and design that I truly enjoy. My redesigned app page is viewable through the link attached to the title.</p>
