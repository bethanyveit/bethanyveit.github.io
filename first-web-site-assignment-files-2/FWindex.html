      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
      <p>JMU Club Cheer is a sports organization here on campus at James Madison University. We are student run by an executive board that gets voted in by the previous team. The team runs through <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/recreation/sport-clubs/clubs/competitivecheer.shtml" target="_blank" style="color:purple">UREC</a> who oversees what we do. Club Cheer is personally funded through fundraisers and dues from the team members. We compete in competitions along the East Coast. Since we have to fund everything ourselves, the number of competitions we are able to attend depends on dues and which competitions fit with our academic calendar.</p>
      <p>Club Cheer is more than just a sport, we are a family. Joining this club will help you find friends with similar interests as you and will bond you to people you can rely on during your life here at JMU.</p>

    <section id="section2" class="gold-bg">
      <h2>How do I join? What does it take?</h2>
      <p>We are an all inclusive all-girl team. We accept female full-time JMU students. Skill level or experience does not matter but it is encouraged to have at least a back-handspring but if you do not, you will not be disregarded for the team.</p>
      <p>We hold tryouts during the fall semester that run across three days and entail: tumbling, stunting, and a dance that is taught on the first day. Cuts will be made on all of the days if necessary.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="section3">
  		<h3>How much of a commitment is the team?</h3>
  		<p>The team has three mandatory practices per week -
        <br>Monday & Wednesday: 7-9pm
        <br>Sunday: 9-11pm
      <p>We also travel over weekends when we have competitions. We would usually travel Friday-Sunday for two day competitions or we will leave and come back in the same day for one day competitions. If the venue is a little farther and it is a one day competition we will consider staying over the night before.</p>
      <p>The athletes on the team are also required to pay dues to cover hotels, van rentals, bows, and competition costs. &#40;If you are familiar with competitive cheer, you will be aware that competitions are very expensive and most are about &#36;100 per athlete; so by paying the dues, this expense is covered.&#41;</p>
      <p> UREC also requires students that are a part of a club team to complete around 5 hours of community service. This helps us get a small amount of money from UREC to go toward our club and also allows us first choice on our practice times if athletes do not like the current times we have.</p>
