<div class="section1">
    <h3>Tryouts</h3>
    <p>Tryouts for college cheerleading can be very daunting. Everyone there is very serious about making the team, but they only have so many spots for new people on the team. When you go into college tryouts, especially as a senior in highschool, you're extremely nervous because you usually don't know anyone and you have no idea what the tryouts are going to be like. Also, all the returners know each other and have a bond so it can be very intimidating. However, a lot fo the returners are very willing to help the newbies out and guide them in any direction they need.</p>
</div>

<div class="section2">
    <h3>Practices</h3>
    <p>Practices for collegiate cheer vary vastly depending on what college you're attending. For JMU varsity cheer, during a standard year, we have three practices a week at two hours each: Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. On weeks where there is either a football or basketball game, we have an extra Friday practice, but it is shortened to usually about an hour. For other, larger cheer colleges such as UK, Liberty, Louisville, and Navarro, I'm sure they have practice everyday, but I am not sure.</p>
</div>
    
<div class="section3">
    <h3>Competitions</h3>
    <p>There are only two main collegiate competitions. Colleges compete at one or the other depending if they are a UCA or an NCA school. NCA cheer nationals take place in Daytona. The comepetition is televised and outside on the bandshell. UCA cheer nationals take place in Disney World at the Wide World of Sports. This competition is also televised. You work all year for that one competition and it is the msot rewarding feeling getting on that stage. Some schools have a nationals fund in their budget, but others do not. For JMU last year, as a team we had to fundraise some money, but we went and our all-girl team placed fourth!</p>
</div>

<div class="section4">
    <h3>Other Information</h3>
    <p>College cheer (at least at JMU) is free. You don't have any fees to pay, but you do have to do community service and other events. I was concerned that it would be a very time consuming and large commitment, and it is, but it's one that is very enjoyable. I have plenty of time for school work and a job. The JMU cheerleading team is one big family. We all help each other out with classes and skills and we jsut want the best for everyone.</p>
    <p>If you are not interested in the commitment of the full team, JMU, and other colleges do usually have a club program. This means that there is no coach, but there is an exec board that runs the team. They usually are set up like an allstar team where they go to competitions. However, you do not get to cheer at football or basketball games. There is a fee which usually ranges from $150-$250. FOr JMU's club cheer team, they usually go to about 4 or 5 competitions within a seasn. Tryouts are held around September and they take people of all skill levels.</p>
