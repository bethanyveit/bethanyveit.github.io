    <h2>More Information</h2>
    <p>If you're looking into just starting to cheer, I would suggest going online and looking up reviews of allstar cheer gyms around your area. Once you've found one that looks appealing, I would go into the gym and talk to the person at the front desk, and/or even the owners if they're available that day. Take a tour and get a feel of the atmosphere. I would do that until you've found one you're truly happy with. Don't settle on a place you don't feel 100% comfortable in because you'll be spending a lot of time there.</p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#E5E5E5;">
    <h2>Collegiate Cheer</h2>
    <p>If you're looking into cheering in college, I would suggest going onto the schools Facebook page and send the coach an email or message about your interest. Coaches are there for your benefit, take advantage of that. Ask about tryouts and open gyms and getting a feel for the team. More times than not, coaches are willing to let people sit in on practices.</p>
