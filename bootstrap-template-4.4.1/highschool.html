<div class="section1">
    <h3>Tryouts</h3>
    <p>Depending on your area and how good your school has done in the past, highschool tryouts can also be very daunting. Many kids that have done allstar cheerleading tryout for highschool. However, those who maybe cheered when they were very young but still have skills are also likely to tryout for highschool cheer. It is a lot less stressful as there are a lot less people at the tryout. However, the main difference between highschool and allstar cheerleading is that everything is done on a deadmat. This means that there are no springs under the mat. It is simply the two or three inch mat laid across (usually) a basketball floor. Tryouts for highschool usually consist of a dance, a cheer, a chant, stunting, and tumbling. Most schools divide students up into a JV/Varsity team, however, not everyone that trys out is guaranteed a spot on either team.</p>

<div class="section2">
    <h3>Practices</h3>
    <p>Practices for highschool cheerleading are usually everyday right afterschool ends, and usually last for about 2 hours. They tend to be a lot less intense than allstar practices but still as demanding. For highschool you have to practice both cheers and a routine. For most highschools, fall cheer is for football and then winter cheer is for basketball. Most of the time, practices right before games will be cheer reviews and stunt practice for groups that want to do things during the games. The routine is sloghtly different as it will be a normal routine, bt=ut needs to include a cheer, a chant, and a crowd response. </p>
</div>
    
<div class="section3">
    <h3>Competitions</h3>
    <p>Competitions for highschool cheer are definitely still as nervewracking even though they are in front of a much smaller crowd. They usually take place in a highschool gym and include all the schools from your district. After your district competitions, those that do well move onto regionals, and then states. States is when all of the highschools from your particular state come together (usually at a college gym) to compete for the state cheerleading title.</p>

<div class="section4">
    <h3>Other Information</h3>
    <p>Highschool cheer is much less demanding than allstar. The only traveling really occurs for football games and competitions and you leave and return within the same day/night. There are usually fees you have to pay but they tend to be pretty low and range from about $100-$200. Travel and food is also usually included in that as well. Highschool as well as allstar are a good mix if you want to cheer in college. Highschool gives you the football game aspect while allstar gives you the skills you need.</p>
