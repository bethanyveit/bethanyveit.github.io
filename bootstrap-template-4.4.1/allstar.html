     <p>Tryouts, Practices, Competitions, etc.</p>
</header>

<div class="section1">
    <h3>Tryouts</h3>
    <p>Tryouts for allstar cheer teams start around March. You tryout based on your age and then will usually get weeded out into your different levels from there. Every gym does it differently, but tryouts for allstar usually consist of tumbling, stunting, and a dance. For stunting, once they break kids up into their different levels, they will bring all the people of similar levels together and the coaches will form stunt groups. The coaches will then tell everyone to warm up, and then start telling groups what skills they want to see from them. The gyms are all usually very hot as there is no air conditioning.</p>
</div>

<div class="section2">
    <h3>Practices</h3>
    <p>Practices for allstar cheerleading is usually 3 times a week. It will either be a Tuesday/Thursday/and a Saturday or Sunday or a Monday/Wednesday/and a Saturday or Sunday. Coaches expect you to be on time to every single practice no matter what. Practices usually occur around 5pm or later and work around school times. However, if you do another sport for your middle or highschool, allstar practice is expected to be your first priority. It can be stressful for both parents and atheletes trying to run from one practice to another, but usually if you talk to your coach and explain your situation and depending how far you are from the gym, they may make exceptions on your arrival time.</p>

<div class="section3">
    <h3>Competitions</h3>
    <p>Competitions are hands down the best part of allstar cheerleading. Many of them are in large convention centers, venues, or stadiums. Gyms from all around your area show up and you compete in divisions based on your level, team size, and whether you're an all-girl team or coed team. Doing well in a competition is the msot rewarding feeling because you work so hard all year for that reason. Level 6 and up teams compete for the ability to go to worlds. Certain comeptitions give out "bids" or money toward being able to fund a teams trip to Disney for the Cheerleading World's competition.</p>
    <p>The Cheerleading World's is when the best teams from each region in the U.S. and even overseas come together to compete against each other. Placing in Worlds means that you're the team to beat in the future. The competition is televised so cheer fans from all over the world can watch it. People that are really big fans of certain teams will follow them and their routines to see how they do throughout the season and make predictions on how they think they will do at Worlds.</p>

    <h3>Other Information</h3>
    <p>First of all, allstar cheerleading is a very expensive sport. You pay thousands of dollars that goes toward the gym, uniforms, makeup, shoes, practice wear, and competition fees. That does not include the cost to travel, hotel fees, food, or anything else you might need while either out of town or out of state for a competition. Second of all, allstar cheerleading is a very mentally challenging sport. From the mental illnesses taht people develop because of the sport, to the pure pressure that is put on young children to get skills and to keep constantly improving. It is also very physically demanding, like any other sport. Many children who get into allstar cheerleading are very very fit kids by the time they reach their teens. It requires a lot of conditioning and strength.</p>
