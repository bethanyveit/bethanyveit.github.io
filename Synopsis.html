        <h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
            <p>This website was a little challenging to put together. I couldn't get it to look exactly how I wanted it too, so I unfortunately spent a lot of time on cosmetic changes and not so focused on content. I tried to create a grid layout but I couldn't get it to work on my site so I had to abandon that idea. I also found it difficult to use a single style page to work for all of my pages. Instead of making a picture the background of my site, I decided to make it just the background of my header. I kept the rest of the page pretty simple, using different colors as the backgrounds of my different headers, going from light to dark as you go down.</p> 
        <h3>OBJECTIVES</h3>
            <p>I wanted this website to push my comfort zone, and it certainly did. I had never created a website to this extent before this class. I enjoyed it, but it pushed my creative thoughts in ways I wasn't always sure how to deal with. I want this sit to eventually be a sort of online portfolio for me, but I know it's going to take a good amount of time before I get to that place. I need to keep tweaking aspects until I am fully happy with the final product, but I know with enough work I can make it work and turn it into something I am proud to show employers.</p>
        <h3>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h3>
            <p>I definitely learned that putting everything together takes a lot more time than you expect it to. I found that making things look how I wanted them to was an extreme amount of trial and error, and even then I still couldn't get it to look how I wanted it to. For example, I wanted each page to be similar but slightly different, but I wasn't able to do that using only one style sheet. I think I may have relied too heavily on the syle sheet and not used enought inline css.</p>
