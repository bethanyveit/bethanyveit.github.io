        <p style="margin-top: 60px">Career-wise, in the future, as of right now I think I would like to work in the field of front-end website design/upkeep. I think one of the msot important things for a busines these days is to have an attractive, well working website. When I first started the SMAD program at JMU, I thought I really wanted to work with apps. However, as I have grown and learned more, html/css and website design are really where my passion lies. I love the idea of going from nothing to something and it can be a very rewarding feeling seeing your site come to fruition. It is also very important to me that I find a job that I truly enjoy. I enjoy working on coding and design and I don't want a job to take that feeling away from me just because I need the money.</p>
        <p>When it comes to personal life, as of the current moment, I would really like to move west coast. For what I want to do, there are a lot of companies in California especially that focus on the design side of technology. Although I am aware there are companies all over that hire people for their design departments. I've never been to the west coast, but something about it draws me in. However, I am not too picky, especially when it comes to where I live. I moved a good amount through my childhood and would love to explore new areas no matter where they are.</p>
        <p>I also would like ot eventually provide things for my parents. They are already on the older side and have always provided for me, and I feel a sort of responsibility to be able to do the same for them when they can no longer provide for themselves.</p>
