                <p>I attended Loudoun County Highschool in Leesburg, Virginia from 2013-2017. I was on the varsity cheerleading team for freshman, sophomore, and senior year. Everyone says junior year of highschool is the harded and I wanted to focus on classes and cheerleading is a very demanding sport. However, during the spring sports season of junior year, I tried gymnastics as I had gotten comfortable with my school work and didn't want to not participate in a sport. My senior year at LCHS, I joined the newspaper staff. I ended up becoming the A&#38;E editor. I really enjoyed the job and it piqued my interest in journalism. However, I found more joy in designing the layout of the pages which is how I knew the School of Media Art and Design (SMAD) was the right one to apply for at James Madison Univeristy (JMU).</p>

            <div class="column right">
                <p>Transitioning from highschool to JMU was defintiely very daunting and intimidating. I had never really been apart from my parents, and being two hours away from my house at the time seemed like a scary, but also exciting new adventure. I decided not to try out for the varsity cheer team going into college as I knew it was a large commitment I wasn't sure if I was ready for. Instead, I joined the club cheerleading team where I made a lot of my clsoe friends. I did club for two years and although I lvoed it, going into my junior year I knew that I wanted to tryout for the varsity team, so I did. Joining varsity cheer at JMU was one of the best decisions I ever made. I made so many new friends and love every second of cheering on the school. the major of SMAD also was a perfect fit. Doing what I enjoy for a major make my projects not feel like work, but enjoyment.</p>
