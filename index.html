        <h1>WELCOME TO MY SITE!</h1>
            <p>Thank you for checking out my website! On this page you will be able to find out a little bit about me, as well as navigate to other pages. You can find my resume, some of my past SMAD assignments, some photos that I have taken, and a synopsis of what I thought of this project. At the very bottom of my pages, in the footer, you will also be able to find links to other sites that I find inspiring.</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Bethany Veit and I am from Leesburg, VA. I am currently a junior at James Madison University and am pursuing a Bachelors of Art degree from the School of Media Art and Design with a concentration in Interactive Design. I am also on the Varsity Coed cheerleading team, so during the fall you can catch me on the side of the football field, and during the spring I am cheering on our basketball teams. I love to be moving, whether it's working out, hiking, swimming, or just going for a walk with my friends. This past summer I worked with the Volkswagen Academy in Reston, VA as a technology intern. I helped design an online handbook, create logos, shoot videos, and design a new online learning module for dealers. However, this coming summer, I will be working for UCA &#40;Universal Cheerleaders Association&#41; as a staff member. So, I will be travelling along the east coach working camps for highschool and other college cheer programs. I also love the outdoors, being outside is one of my favorite things, no matter what I am doing. My friends and I go hiking a good amount during the summer and even when we're back here at JMU.</p>
            <p>My family means the world to me. No matter what, they are always supporting me throughout all my academic and athletic decisions. We have progressively moved down the east coast as my brother and I have gotten older. We moved within Massachusetts once, and we lived there up until I was around 11 years old; then we moved to New Hampshire, but justt for one school year because we found out that my father was being relocated down here for his job, and we have been in Virginia ever since.</p>
