        <h3>Book Cover Redesign</h3>
        <img src="Images/Screen%20Shot%202018-10-12%20at%206.48.26%20PM.png" alt="Book Cover Redesign" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 12.5vw;">
        <p style="margin-left: 12.5vw; margin-right: 12.5vw; margin-top: 1vw;">This was one of my first real graphic design style project for one of my classes. Now, I definitely don't love most things about this, but I do love the front cover design and the car design that is on the bottom of the spine as well as the back cover. My style has always been pretty minimalistic, and this redesign was a great way to show off that you can make an effective book cover that isn't very busy. This design was made for print so that it could be displayed on a tangible hard cover copy of the book.</p>

        <h3>Internship - Volkswagen of America: Training Academy</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 12.5vw; margin-right: 12.5vw; margin-top: 1vw;">The summer of 2019 I had an intsernship with Volkswagen of America's Training Academy where they dealt with training employees that worked in the dealerships. Due to the confidential nature of the work, I cannot show it here on my portfolio, however, most of my work was graphic design based. I created multiple different logos that were used for different mediums that were distributed throughout the company. I also created an interactive handbook that was distributed to new dealership hires.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 12.5vw; margin-right: 12.5vw; margin-top: 1vw;">This HTML/CSS project I am really proud of. This was the first time that I had completed a site and felt really good about it. It has a light modern color scheme and a layout that is very easy to understand. I had to use a bootstrap template but I used one that was completely blank so everything that is on the site was coded by me manually.</p>

        </h3>
        
        <p style="margin-left: 12.5vw; margin-right: 12.5vw; margin-top: 1vw;">During my final semester, I had to take a capstone which was essentially a semester long project where me and my team of both front and back end designers had to create a site for a real client that they could implement into their system and daily activities. Me and one other worked on the front-end design of the site and we were able to make a very professional looking site. We started with a bootstrap template and modified from there to fit our site's needs. </p>

        <h3>This Website - Portfolio</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 12.5vw; margin-right: 12.5vw; margin-top: 1vw;">This website is also a display of my html/css knowledge. Everything on here was coded manually by me, no bootstrap or template. I used what I learned in the classroom to create a portfolio site that I am proud of. I used a modern colorscheme and simple tags to create a website that was my own and not one that was generated by WordPress, Wix or another prebuilt site host.</p>

        </h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 12.5vw; margin-right: 12.5vw; margin-top: 1vw;">Before we could start coding the site for the capstone class, we had to do user research and create a document that showed our process, our thinking, and the reason who we think the target audience is based off of the research we conducted. I had done a few other documents similar to this, but this was definitely the biggest one I have completed. </p>

        </h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 12.5vw; margin-right: 12.5vw; margin-top: 1vw;">This was a very basic two page website that I needed to design in order to show off the ps.j5 work that we had created before the capstone project actually began. This site used a Bootstrap template, but was coded manually using Brackets.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 12.5vw; margin-right: 12.5vw; margin-top: 1vw;">This was one of my first experiences with a UX/UI portfolio site. This site was created for a class where we had to do research for a site of our choice. I chose to do mine on a compiled site of restaurants in downtown Harrisonburg, VA. Wordpress was used as the main host platform, so only minimal CSS coding was done manually. </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 12.5vw; margin-right: 12.5vw; margin-top: 1vw;">For this video, me and two other team members filmed a promotional video for the JMU Mens Rugby team. I took part in working the camera, the microphone, and assisted with editing the video using iMovie. </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 12.5vw; margin-right: 12.5vw; margin-top: 1vw;">Throughout the duration of my internship, I helped filmed promotional and informational videos that were distributed internally to both corporate and dealership employees. Unfortunately, since it was all for internal employees only, I am not able to provide them for you. I participated in assisting with the filming and setting up the studio. </p>
